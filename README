This is an Emacs mode for editing Turtle (RDF) files.

It is based on an excellent start made by Hugo Haas, at
<http://larve.net/people/hugo/2003/scratchpad/NotationThreeEmacsMode.html>.
I've extended it to support indentation, some electric punctuation,
and hungry delete.

To use, download the file ttl-mode.el from https://bitbucket.org/nxg/ttl-mode/src
(or clone the project), put the file in the emacs load path (look at the variable
load-path to find where emacs currently searches), and add something
like the following to your .emacs file.

    (autoload 'ttl-mode "ttl-mode" "Major mode for OWL or Turtle files" t)
    (add-hook 'ttl-mode-hook    ; Turn on font lock when in ttl mode
              'turn-on-font-lock)
    (setq auto-mode-alist
          (append
           (list
            '("\\.n3" . ttl-mode)
            '("\\.ttl" . ttl-mode))
           auto-mode-alist))
